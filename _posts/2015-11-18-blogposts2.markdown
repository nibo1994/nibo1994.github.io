###What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?
robots.txt is a text file that gives instruction to web robots aka web crawlers.
You add the txt file in the root of your site.

####My txt file:
{% highlight ruby %}
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
{% endhighlight %}

This file won't allow any robots to visit any pages.

Observe that this isn't in any way a protection from illegal malwares.

###What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?
humans.txt is a file made for the users to be able to see who's the creator of the site.
You configure it by simply add a text file in the root of your site including information about whoever that's behind the site.
